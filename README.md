# Prank Master 2020

## What this does:
- Opens up random websites in a list.
    - Note:
        - Nothing seriously dangerous or harmful!
        - You can add websites of your choice to the list.
            - The list is ```database.txt``` file under scripts.
## How to use:
1. Install Python3.x on the PC you plan to use this prank on.
    - from here! ```https://www.python.org/```
    - If your ~~victim~~ (cough cough) friend's PC is running Linux or Mac OS than it is likely that it is already installed.
2. Set this program to run on startup.
3. Have fun!
